# Milestone 1


### 5College FOMO Milestone One

### Data interactions
- Ability for people to post and edit events. Which includes imagines, text, location (Google Maps API), signups (Email, Facebook).
- Feature these events on a public news board.
- Add comments for events (maybe through Facebook API).
- Only letting people with five college emails (umass.edu, hcc.edu etc) create accounts to post events. Otherwise no need to login to view events.
