### Project name

Five College FOMO

### Team Overview

- Emma Wolff @wolff23e
- Sathvik Birudavolu @BSathvik
- Rahul Alluri @ralluri-sudo

### Innovative Idea

 We aim to create a website to instill community and access to opportunity across the five college consortium. We believe many students attending Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Smith, and Umass Amherst are not able to fully benefit from the vast five college network of clubs, events, guest lectures, and so forth due to lack of centralized information.

Although the Five Colleges does have a website, the utility is lacking. For example, instead of listing all orgs based off interests it simply redirects you to each individual college's listing and so Googling seems to be a faster way to get to these links.

Solution? **Five College FOMO**. We will have information at your fingertips based on your interest - whether that is looking for athletic clubs in the area, CS groups to attend hacks with, or religious celebrations of your denomination upcoming calendar.

### Important Components

- Ability for people to post and edit events. Which includes imagines, text, location (Google Maps API), signups (Email, Facebook).
- Feature these events on a public news board.
- Add comments for events (maybe through Facebook API).
- Only letting people with five college emails (umass.edu, hcc.edu etc) create accounts to post events. Otherwise no need to login to view events.
