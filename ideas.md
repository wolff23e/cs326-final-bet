Innovative Idea
 which provides a brief paragraph or two describing your application and how it relates to other existing applications. If your application does not relate to an existing application then mention that. 
 We aim to create a website to instill community and access to opportunity across the five college consortium. We believe many students attending Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Smith, and Umass Amherst are not able to fully benefit from the vast five college network of clubs, events, guest lectures, and so forth due to lack of centralized information.
 
Though the Five Colleges does have a website, the utility is lacking as instead of listing all orgs based off interests it simply redirects you to each individual colleges listings... something you could have done with Google faster. 

Solution?  "Five College FOMO"  
We will have information at your fingertips based on your interest - whether that is looking for athletic clubs in the area, CS groups to attend hacks with, or religious celebrations of your denomination upcoming calendar.

Account holders with valid 5 college emails can add events to our calendar, or send us information to add to our listings if they're running a non-college affiliated org or group!}
